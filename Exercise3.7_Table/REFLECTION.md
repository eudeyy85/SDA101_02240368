# Main Concepts
The main concept of the above code is to create a weekly course schedule in HTML with a table layout. This schedule visually organizes classes by days of the Week (Columns), time Slots (Rows) where the table displays a course scheduled at a specific time on a specific day.

# New Skills and knowledge acquired
Learned how to use tables to organize information in a grid format, particularly for schedules or timetables, experimenting with colors and background styling to differentiate header cells, time slots, and course cells.

# What I Learned.
I learned to make the table styles make the table take the full page width (width: 100%) and remove space between cells with border-collapse, to make th and td (table header and data cells) are styled with borders, padding, and centered text and also to make  color choices and layout improve readability and organization, making it easy for a viewer to glance at their weekly course schedule.

# Challenges I Have Faced
-  mistake in <tr>, <th>, or <td> tags made misalignments.
-  tables were't responsive
-  missing closing tags (</tr> or </td>) and to misplaced attributes, which made it hard to identify errors in the table structure.
- the css styles didn't apply as expected if there’s an error in the syntax or if there’s a specificity conflict, leading to unexpected results.
