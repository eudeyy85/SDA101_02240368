# Main Concepts
The main concept of the code is to create a table to display job listings with the following columns: Job Title, Company, Location, and Application Deadline.

# New Skills and knowledge acquired
- The border-collapse property removes the space between table borders, making the table cleaner and more compact.
- width: 100% makes the table span the full width of its container.
- The tr:hover selector changes the background color of a row when the user hovers over it with their mouse, providing a visual cue to improve interactivity.

# What I Learned.
I learned how to create a structured tables for displaying data, the use of <tr>, <th>, and <td> to define rows and columns in a table, and to list job with attributes like job title, company, location, and application deadlines using a table format. Using styling tables for readability using properties like border-collapse, padding, and text-align and also to hover effects using the tr:hover selector which makes the table more interactive and engaging.

# Challenges I Have Faced
- misplacing tags like tr,th or td leading to some issues.
- didn't know to make uniform padding, borders, and background colors.
