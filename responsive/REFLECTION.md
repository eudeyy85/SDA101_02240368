# Main Concepts
The main concept of the code is to create a simple webpage with a micro interaction using TailwindCSS and ensure it's fully responsive.

# New Skills and knowledge acquired
- to make layout to be responsive by using Tailwind's utility classes,to make the text-center and responsive text sizes which allows the text to adjust depending on the screen size.
- with the help of tailwind utility classes for styling background colors,tex color and spacing, and knew that the shadow effect gives the header and footer a subtle depth effect.
- the link styled as a button (<a href="#">CLICK HERE!!!</a>) has a hover effect using Tailwindâ€™s hover:bg-purple-800 for color change and hover:scale-105 to slightly enlarge the button.
- the meta tag with viewport settings ensures the page renders well on various devices by controlling the scaling and layout on smaller screens and to make copyright and social link in the footer.

# What I Learned.
I learned how to create a layout to addapt in different screen sizes using Tailwind CSS's responsive utilities, the Tailwind CSS allows for rapid styling with utility classes which simplifies the design process by applying styles directly in the HTML markup and the hover and transition classes to demonstrate how to add interactive behaviors and smooth animations to elements with minimal code.Even learned that the flex and flex-col classes are used to create a flexible, column-based layout that helps in centering content both horizontally and vertically and the min-h-screen ensures that the layout takes up at least the full height of the viewport, which is crucial for full-page designs. Moreover, learned to include  social media handles like TikTok and Twiter in the footer to connect the website to social media platforms.


# Challenges I Have Faced
- did tailwind css in separate css file instead of using it within the HTML.
- didn't know that to make Tailwind CSS responsive design system lies on screen breakpoints like sm,md nd lg.
- to design a footer that includes social media links without making it look overwheling.
