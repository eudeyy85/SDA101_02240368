# Main Concepts
The main concept of the above code is to create a weekly course schedule in HTML with a table layout. This schedule visually organizes classes by days of the Week (Columns), time Slots (Rows) where the table displays a course scheduled at a specific time on a specific day.

# New Skills and knowledge acquired
Learned how to use tables to organize information in a grid format, particularly for schedules or timetables, experimenting with colors and background styling to differentiate header cells, time slots, and course cells.

# What I Learned.
I learned to set up  a photo gallery where each image is enclosed in a <div class="gallery"> container to display multiple images, .gallery class uses a CSS grid layout with grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); where the gallery adjust the number of columns based on the width of the container and the usage of the auto-fit and minmax functions in the grid layout, the gallery is designed to be responsive.

# Challenges I Have Faced
-  While using grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)) is intended to make the gallery responsive, on smaller screens, images might look stretched or squished, if they have a variety of aspect ratios.
