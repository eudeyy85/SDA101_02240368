# Main Concepts
The main concept of the above code is to create a simple landing page for a fictional e-commerce site that sells tech gadgets. The page should include a navigation bar, a grid-based product listing section, and a footer.

# New Skills and knowledge acquired
Learned the function of header,nav,footer to orgnize the sections,learned to group the same element, and the function of alt attribute to support the importance of including alternate text.Then in css learned to simplifies layout by using padding and border within element dimensions, the grid-template-columns has been set to changes dynamically using media queries and media queries adjust the number of columns for larger screens (repeat(3, 1fr) and repeat(4, 1fr)), which is a crucial skill for responsive design.Moreover, the @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

# What I Learned.
I learned to make the structured sections, such as <header>, <main>, and <footer>, help separate page content logically and improve readability, then to make navigation (<nav>) contains an unordered list to keep  items structured and easy to style with CSS and the uses of alt attributes in image tags is to improves accessibility for screen readers, enabling visually impaired users to understand the images.

# Challenges I Have Faced
While doing the code for the E-STORE to make multi column girds which adjust different devices,making all images same dimension and centering navigation links and evenly keeping space in header and footer.
